Formal Methods Seminar: The compactness and Löwenheim–Skolem theorems
======================================================================

The Philosophy department at the University of Bristol run a seminar for new
postgraduates on [Formal Methods], covering both mathematical and philosophical
logic, as well as formal epistemology, decision theory, and other formal or
mathematical techniques employed by philosophers.

The files included here form my contribution to that seminar: a presentation of
the compactness and Löwenheim–Skolem theorems, two of the fundamental results
in model theory. The Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy have made the
[PDF version] available from the section of their website on [learning
mathematical philosophy].
